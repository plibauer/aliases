1. Checkout a clone of the repository in your home directory using;

      >git clone git@github.com:plibauer/aliases.git

  or, for read only checkout (won't be able to push), you can also use;

      >get clone http://plibauer@github.com/plibauer/aliases.git

  See the Google Drive document "Git repository" for information on how to setup ssh access from anywhere.

2. Create a soft link to the home or work file;

      >ln -s ~/aliases/aliases_{home|work}.txt  ~/aliases/aliases

  This will make sure it gets sourced correctly.

3. Copy the file ../aliases/aliases_local.txt.remove_postfix to aliases_local.txt
  Configure all the localised paths to the repository drive and SVN mirror directories etc.

4. Run the python script ~/python/make_env.py --config ~/python/make_env.config  to produce an environment file for 
  the next step. For the latest branch, the convention is to name it 'trunkenvironment'
  
5.In your ~/.tcshrc file, put in the initial source command for which environment you would like to default to.
  Some examples are shown below;


  	source ~/aliases/90environment

  or,
  
  	source ~/aliases/trunkenvironment
