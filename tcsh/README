1. Checkout a clone of the repository in your home directory using;

      >git clone git@github.com:plibauer/aliases.git

  or, for read only checkout (won't be able to push), you can also use;

      >get clone http://plibauer@github.com/plibauer/aliases.git

  See the Google Drive document "Git repository" for information on how to setup ssh access from anywhere.

2. Run the python script make_env.py to produce an environment file for the next step.
   If the config file is different to the default of make_env.config, specify it using the 
   --config option.
  
3.In your ~/.tcshrc file, put in the initial source command for which environment you would like to default to.
  Some examples are shown below;


  	source ~/aliases/90environment

  or,
  
  	source ~/aliases/trunkenvironment
