After checking out the sources to ~/aliases,  create a soft link to the home or work file;

      >ln -s ~/aliases/aliases_{home|work}.txt  ~/aliases/aliases

This will make sure it gets sourced correctly.
In your ~/.tcshrc file, put in the initial source command for which environment you would like to default to;

file: ~/.tcshrc
===============

  source ~/aliases/72environment
